<h1>Book Me!</h1>

<p>Utilizes the New York Times Best Seller and Google Books APIs to quickly view the current Best Sellers lists and then preview individual books.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>I have always found it difficult to choose from the New York Times Best Sellers lists due to a lack of context.
                I set out to build an app that allows you to preview each title and see if it is worth a read.</p><br>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>After initiating the app, please select 
                a genre that interests you. This will pull up the most recently published
                best sellers list. From here you can select a cover in order to
                view a summary and preview the book. Enjoy!</p>
